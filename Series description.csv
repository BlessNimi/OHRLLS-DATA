Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate);This indicator provides information on employment across different economic activities. Information by sector of economic activity is particularly useful in identifying broad shifts in employment and stages of development. Having detailed statistics on employment by economic activity allows for the calculation of the share of manufacturing in total employment, which was included as one of the indicators proposed to measure progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), under Goal 9 (Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation);World bank

GDP (constant 2015 US$);GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2015 prices, expressed in U.S. dollars. Dollar figures for GDP are converted from domestic currencies using 2015 official exchange rates. For a few countries where the official exchange rate does not reflect the rate effectively applied to actual foreign exchange transactions, an alternative conversion factor is used.;World bank

Merchandise exports (current US$);"""International merchandise trade measures the value of goods which add or subtract from the stock of material resources of an economy by entering or leaving its territory (United Nations, 2011).
Unless otherwise stated in country notes, the value of exports is recorded as the free-on-board value (FOB), whereas the value of imports includes the cross-border insurance and freight costs from the  exporting to the importing economy (so-called CIF value).
The trade flows shown in this table are on general trade system basis for all countries except those listed in the notes in dimension """"flow"""", which employ the special trade system. The general trade system is used when the statistical territory of a compiling country coincides with its economic territory. Consequently, imports include all goods entering the economic territory of a compiling country and exports include all goods leaving the economic territory of the compiling country. The special trade system is used when the statistical territory comprises only a particular part of the economic territory within which “goods may be disposed of without customs restriction”. In such a case, imports include all goods entering the free circulation area of the compiling country, which means cleared through customs for home use, and exports include all goods leaving the free circulation area of a compiling country.
Totals of international merchandise trade presented in this table are not strictly comparable with those in UNCTADstat merchandise trade matrix. Discrepancies arise due to the use of different complementary sources.""";UNCTAD
